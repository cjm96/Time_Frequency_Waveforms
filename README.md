# Getting Started

# Documentation

# Testing

To check that everything is working as expected you can run the unit tests. 

The tests are run with `pytest`. 
You will first need to ensure you have this installed; this can be done by installing with dev extras.

```bash
pip install .[dev]
```

You will then be able to run all the tests. 
(Make sure you are in the directory cotaining the pyproject.toml file.)

```bash
python -m pytest
```
